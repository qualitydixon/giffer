# Giffer

[LIVE DEMO](https://qualitydixon.github.io/giffer/)

## Built with...

This project was made with React, React-Router, Webpack, Less, Axios, and ESLint (airbnb).

## Installation

Fork and clone this repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run start`. You will see the project at `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

## Considerations

- The end user experience is always of the utmost importance.  Think about how users will want to use the experience you create and make it as friendly and intuitive as possible.
- Are there transitions or animations that will enhance the overall feel of the app to improve the user experience?
  * **Yes. My focus for this project was to implement clean, sensible animations/transitions.**
- What happens the first time someone loads the experience?  What about future visits?
- Responsive?
  * **Yes! A small mobile screen does not provide the best experience but it's fully functional.**
- Shareable?
  * **Facebook and Twitter buttons for each gif**
- Can parts of the app be built so they could be easily reused in future projects?
  * **Yes. I recycled components from previous projects and the same could be done here.**
- Would another developer be able to easily jump into your code to make updates?
  * **I think so but I suppose code is always readable to the person who wrote it. I'd be interested to hear someone else's opinion.**
- Are there parts of the code that should be documented or does the code speak for itself?
  * **I make an effort to make my code 'self-documenting'. Using React helps with this a lot.**

## Bonus
- Deploy your app on Heroku to share a link with us
  * **Deployed to gh-pages**
- Use audio in the app
- Use another API for added features of your app
- Works in IE9?
  * **Well it doesn't work in IE11 so I'm guessing not...**
