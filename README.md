## Objective

To show off your skills as a frontend developer and how they fit into a potential role at Barbershop. Showcase your ability to create fun, engaging UI and write clean code.

## Requirements

Very few.  This is your chance to explore.

- Use git for version control and push your code to bitbucket or github or us to review.
- Use any frameworks or tools that you think are appropriate and be ready to explain the reasoning behind the choices you make
- Be sure app is responsive

## Considerations

- The end user experience is always of the utmost importance.  Think about how users will want to use the experience you create and make it as friendly and intuitive as possible.
- Are there transitions or animations that will enhance the overall feel of the app to improve the user experience?
- What happens the first time someone loads the experience?  What about future visits?
- Responsive?
- Shareable?
- Can parts of the app be built so they could be easily reused in future projects?
- Would another developer be able to easily jump into your code to make updates?
- Are there parts of the code that should be documented or does the code speak for itself?

## Bonus
- Deploy your app on Heroku to share a link with us
  * Deployed to gh-pages
- Use audio in the app
- Use another API for added features of your app
- Make it work on IE9
